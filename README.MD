# JavaScript Function Finder

This is a project made in JSP (JaveServer Pages) that will analyze your JavaScript code and print the lines where a function has been found

This is the first of three (3) different projects that I've made for the Advanced Programming course at the Polytechnic University of Puerto Rico, San Juan Campus.

This project creates files on a folder of your choice to store the account files as well as the analyzed codes, results, and history.

To change the directory where the files are located, please change the `FileDirectory` variable in the `config.java` file.

There are other options there that must be setup in order to send the account validation email. These options are also found in the `config.java` file.

You'll need to have Tomcat installed in your system to run this project.
